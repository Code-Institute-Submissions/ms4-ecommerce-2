Footer
Navbar
Thanks to bootstrap the navbar is responsive, fully functional and developed quickly. For some screen sizes CSS was required with help of the media queries.

Pots
The post are being displayed through a jinja for loop, depending on the offset and the limit prestablished in the backend program, this data only will four posts per pagination page, which each pagination page will be displayed at the end of the four post.

Pagination
in order to develop the pagination section, some research was needed to understand how it works and what id does. Lots or reading and some hlep from the man behind Pretty Printed's YouTube channel, despite all the tools and techniques, this was the only way I could undertand the best to then inplement it to Flask to pass it to Jinja.

The pagination section has prev as previous page, next to go to the next page and the numbers which depending on the number of posts stored in the database where every four posts will count as a paginated page.
